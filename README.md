## MiBand Prediction

Forecast what bracket(percentile) of people does a person fall in, based on the walking streak.

In the Regression.xlsx tab, there's a tab called MiBand2 which has the information in two columns regarding
1. The number of days a person walked for continuously without defaulting on any day.
2. The percentile of the population that he belongs wrt the how many days did his streak long for.

Use linear regression to figure out what percentile would that person fall into if they continued their streak for 77 days. 
Check the same by using the observed percentile and compute the error in prediction.

Use transformation of variables to check if you could improve the performance of your model. If yes, give a comparison
of the different models that you fit and select one out of all those and describe why you chose that one over the others.
